* Merge pull request #62 from bryant1410/master
  Fix broken headings in Markdown files
* Add color mode.
  This is a breaking change.
  The printer now offers a color_mode setting: automatic, always, never.
  When given a FILE* stream on linux, the automatic mode will retrieve
  file descriptor behind it and call isatty().

  Close #59
* Fix g++- 7.0.1 -Wshadow warnings in test lib
* Fix -Wshadow warnings from g++ 7.0.1
* Fix -Wimplicit-fallthrough warning from g++ 7.0.1
  The fallthrough (missing break after a case in a switch) is
  not necessary. We can just move the whole default code move
  down after the switch.
* Merge pull request #58 from krf/fix-warning
  Fix -Wmissing-noreturn warning from Clang
* Fix -Wmissing-noreturn warning from Clang
* Merge pull request #56 from akreuzkamp/master
  Operator names are not supported by MSVC out of the box. Using them breaks code that needs to build with MSVC and/or (thus) uses "-fno-operator-names". As a header-only library should pursue maximal
  portability, this PR replaces the single usage of operator names with the more portable operator syntax.
* Use `&&` instead of `and`.

* Merge pull request #44 from ogdf/make-skip-public
  Make StackTraceImpl*::skip_n_firsts() setter public
* Merge pull request #43 from ogdf/make-context-sizes-configurable
  Printer: Make context sizes configurable
* Add install()
* Add support to find_package(Backward)
* Make StackTraceImpl*::skip_n_firsts() setter public
  When the stack trace is used directly (and not by a signal),
  one may want to hide some of the first stack items because
  they will always be the same calls.
* Printer: Make context sizes configurable
* Let Colorizer reset on initialization
* Make Printer::print methods available for streams
* Merge pull request #40 from Jiboo/master
  Don't append definitions if already cached
* Don't append definitions if already cached
* Merge pull request #39 from merlinthered/master
  Some CMake-related fixes
* Export BACKWARD\_[...] CMake variables as cache variables
  If we do not export the variables set in BackwardMacros.cmake as cache variables, they will not be visible wherever add_backward() is called, and the macro will do nothing.
  Also, fix typo `BACKWARD_INCLUDE_DIR` -> `BACKWARD_INCLUDE_DIRS`
* Readme fixes/clarifications for CMake
  Fixed name of BACKWARD_ENABLE variable
  Changed "myproject" to "mytarget" to avoid confusion
* Merge pull request #34 from milianw/fix_bfd_compile_on_archlinux
  Define PACKAGE and PACKAGE_VERSION before including bfd.h
* Merge pull request #35 from vvjcarter/master
  Add current List directory so that BackwardMacros.cmake correctly inc…
* Add current List directory so that BackwardMacros.cmake correctly includes the directory
* Define PACKAGE and PACKAGE_VERSION before including bfd.h
  On ArchLinux at least the bfd.h header errors out early if
  PACKAGE or PACKAGE_VERSION have not been set. This patch
  makes backward.hpp compile on this platform for me.
* Merge pull request #33 from Manu343726/master
  Add ARM support
* Add ARM support
* Merge pull request #30 from akreuzkamp/master
  Split off cmake macros and dependency detection to BackwardMacros.cmake
* Merge pull request #31 from akreuzkamp/fixQtCompatibility
  Fix compatibility to Qt applications
* Rename variable "signals" to "unix_signals".
  This change is needed for compatibility to Qt applications.
  Qt defines a macro "signals" that expands to nothing and is used by
  Qt's meta object compiler (which is kind of a C++ pre-processor) to
  add signal-slot feature (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/signalsandslots.html).
  This will cause compilation of backward.hpp to fail, when used from a
  Qt application, because the variable "signals" will be expanded to ""
  by the cpp pre processor.
* Split off cmake macros and dependency detection.
  This commit seperates some of the CMake code into a
  BackwardMacros.cmake file. Including the CMakeLists.txt with
  add_subdirectory doesn't work, because the variables it defines won't
  be available from the including CMakeLists. With a .cmake file, they
  will.
  This change is backward-compatible, because CMakeLists.txt includes
  the BackwardMacros.cmake as well.
* Merge pull request #27 from gbitzes/master
  Fix typos in README code examples
* Fix typos in README code examples
* Try to get the CMakeLists.txt working and somewhat flexible.
* Merge pull request #23 from edisongustavo/master
  Compile in Visual Studio 2010
* Replace usages of alternative usages of boolean operators with more more standard ones since they don't compile in Visual Studio 2010.
  Replacements are:
  - 'and' => '&&'
  - 'or'  => '||'
  - 'not' => '!'
  Also added some missing includes since MSVC was complaining of missing
  symbols.
* Update README.md
  Remove any references to TraceWithLocals since its not even part of the source anymore.
* Merge pull request #22 from edisongustavo/master
  Compilers with GLIBC < 2.10 don't have the psiginfo() function
* Compilers with GLIBC < 2.10 don't have the psiginfo() function
* Merge pull request #20 from hesiod/master
  Documentation
* Revert 0660344
  Turns out I was wrong, we do need that command.
* Mark most cache values as advanced
  To avoid confusion, hide some configuration value from the normal user.
* Fix CMake style
  I erred concerning CMake variable naming conventions.
* Make feature detection values internal
  Previously, the "feature detection options" (STACK_DETAILS\_* and STACK_WALKING\_*) had to be manually set by an user, but now, we (attempt) to detect libraries based on find_library, thus we don't need those to be cache values anymore. Libraries in non-default paths can be manually added in the corresponding _PATH cache value and for testing purposes, users can also disable libraries by supplying an empty string.
* Fix message type
  Whoops, there is no INFO message type. Make it a WARNING instead.
* Remove unneeded CMake command
  Definitions are already included with add_backward.
* Describe CMake integration
* Merge pull request #19 from hesiod/patch-3
  Fix typo
* Fix typo
  Should be backward_DEFINITIONS instead of BACKWARD_DEFINITIONS.
* Merge pull request #18 from hesiod/patch-2
  Remove BACKWARD_ENABLE_ONLY_IN_DEBUG
* Remove BACKWARD_ENABLE_ONLY_IN_DEBUG
  Doesn't work (yet) because CMake lacks generator expressions when listing source files.
* Merge pull request #15 from hesiod/fix-clang-warning
  Fix compilation warning under clang
* Merge pull request #16 from hesiod/build-system
  Build system
* Require CMake 2.8.8
  Object libraries were introduced in CMake 2.8.8.
  Signed-off-by: Tobias Markus <tobias@markus-regensburg.de>
* Fix compilation warning under clang
  Clang complains about adding const to a reference type having no effect.
  Fix this by adding and using a const_ref_t.
* Improve CMake build system, allow easy integration
  Make backward easier to use for CMake users, enabling easy feature detection and integration.
  We now detect presence of libdw, libbfd and libunwind directly in the script. The macro add_backward adds needed libraries, definitions and the include directory to a target. The pseudo-library enable_backward enables automatic backward processing for common failures to a target.
  If BACKWARD_ENABLE_ONLY_IN_DEBUG is set to true, automatic backward processing is only added when the build type is Debug or RelWithDebInfo.
  To integrate backward in an existing CMake project:
  add_subdirectory(/path/to/backward-cpp)
  add_executable(mytarget example.cpp ${backward_ENABLE})
  add_backward(mytarget)
  BACKWARD_DEFINITIONS has been renamed to backward_DEFINITIONS to have a naming convention for public variables similiar to the find modules.
* Remove unneeded include directive
  There is no "include" directory in backward-cpp and hence no need to include it.
* Add option to disable test compilation
* Merge pull request #14 from hesiod/patch-1
  Include current source directory
* Include current source directory
  When including the project from a parent directory (add_subdirectory), backward.hpp is not found by the tests because we include CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR, which is the parent's source directory. Include CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR instead.
* Merge pull request #13 from fabceolin/master
  Fixing buffer overflow on signals array
* Fixing buffer overflow on signals array
* stackoverflow test
* Tests refactored onto less files.
* Tests are all passing now.
* Better test checking
  - fork every test
  - capture signals
  - more assertion tools
  - test can be expected to fail
* Adding BACKWARD_HAS\_* config in cmake for tests
* A more flexible and factorized stack Printer.
* Add defines for "ATLEAST_CXX11"
* A system specializable demangler implementation.
* Remove unused local var support (for now)
* Remove noisy comments.
* Little typo fix
* Add .gitignore
* Some improvement to builds.sh
* Merge pull request #11 from Kobolog/master
  Fixed an unused parameter warning.
* Proper way to mark a variable unused.
  Instead of explicitly void-ing a variable, just make it anonymous.
* Fix unused parameter warnings.
  In SignalHandling constructor, the empty signal vector is never used,
  which triggers unused parameter warnings at least on Clang 3.2.
* Merge pull request #10 from Kobolog/master
  Unsigned line counters.
* Resolve issue #6: unsigned line counters.
  Change all the line counter variable types from size_t to unsigned, so
  that we can printf() them as '%u' in a portable way, effectively fixing
  build errors on ancient i386 machines.
* Merge pull request #9 from bastih/master
  Remove debug printf
* Remove debug printf from SignalHandling()
* Merge pull request #7 from bastih/master

  This allows for selecting the appropriate signals
  and avoids conflicts with other tools that specific
  signals i.e. profilers
